$ we create a container from a docker image ( snapshot )
docker run ubuntu

# This runs python or downloads and runs python
docker run -it python:3.13.11 

# every image is a debian inside linux !!!
# no matter what we download there is a linux inside !!!

# in order to get access to the file system of the container we # need to specify the "entrypoint"

docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.13.11-slim

#now we are connected to the bash of the container

## now in order to delete all the containers in the docker you 
# need to execute the

docker rm 'docker ps -aq'

# docker ps -aq will show the ids of the containers
